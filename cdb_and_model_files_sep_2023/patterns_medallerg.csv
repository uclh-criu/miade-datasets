Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and {m simvastatin} intolerance (gives him {r diarrhoea}). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to {m Zopiclone} 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea).

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him {m Mirtazapine} 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea).

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking {m pennicillin} (had severe {r rashes}). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea).

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea).

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

In addition, he was allergic to {m grass pollens} and dust mites which raised the possibility of {r asthma}. He was given a food allergy management plan and taught to use an adrenalin pen. His parent were given dietary advice on nut avoidance and offered a referral to a nutritionist.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has {m NSAID} allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with {m Mirtazapine} 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.

Both his sleep and his obsessive behaviours improved considerably with Mirtazapine 15 mg at night. Harley has been able to have uninterrupted sleep at night, which has been amazing! However, Batman became more drowsy during the day and unsteady on his feet. He had a fall in the kitchen two weeks ago and after discussion with his cardiologist and their son, who is a haematologist, they decided to give him Mirtazapine 15 mg every other day. Since then, for the past couple of weeks, his walking has improved, he has had no further falls and Harley does not notice a difference between the nights he takes it and the ones he doesn't. She was planning to stop it completely and she knows it can be re-started as a symptomatic treatment if needed, or consider changing to Zopiclone 5mg. Harley also reports that he had severe reaction after taking pennicillin (had severe rashes). He has NSAID allergy, and simvastatin intolerance (gives him diarrhoea). He is allergic to peanuts and latex.
