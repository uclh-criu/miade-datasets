      "Jenny is 12 years old, living at home and has just started secondary school.  Jenny suffered from severe eczema as a baby and was diagnosed with allergy to egg and cow’s milk.  At the age of 6 Jenny had an anaphylactic reaction and was taken to hospital.  Subsequent tests showed that she was also allergic to peanuts. Jenny was prescribed an adrenaline auto-injector (an Epi-Pen) and also has anti-histamines to help control any symptoms if she has a reaction to food.  She uses anti-histamines to control her eczema and topical fexinidazole if she has a severe flare up.\n",

      "The use of latex gloves in his practice and the pattern of the rash in his hands was suggestive of latex allergy in this patient.\n",

He reports occasional alcohol use and cigar smoking and is up to date on all immunizations.\n",

      "This 14-year-old girl presented with a cough that was keeping her awake at night and causing drowsiness during the day. Her nose was constantly running, causing embarrassment and a nasal blockage at night, exacerbating her sleep disturbance. Her eyes were red, itchy and often discharging clear tears.There was a strong family history of atopy. Her father had asthma and hayfever, and her mother had eczema and hayfever. Her siblings had a variety of atopic conditions, including hayfever, asthma and eczema. The patient herself had no history of atopy. The symptoms indicated hayfever.\n",

      "The patient has a petechial rash that does not have blisters.

      "Four year old baby, presented two days after receiving her routine diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTPa) four-year-old booster immunisation. She had pain and swelling around her injection site. The pain and swelling had commenced approximately 24 hours after the vaccination was administered suggestive of an adverse event following immunization.\n",
      "\n",
      "12 month old baby presented with fever and a generalised non-urticarial rash. He had received his routine 12-month immunisations (ie measles/mumps/rubella [MMR], 13-valent pneumococcal and meningococcal ACWY vaccines) six days prior to presentation. He was well prior to the immunisations being administered but had developed malaise after five days, with fever and rash developing the morning of presentation. This is suggestive of a late AEFI.\n",
