Problem: Patent Ductus Arteriosus 
I spoke to a mother of a new-born who was so anxious about her new-born baby who becomes bluish with the cry. Mother feels the baby is having shortness of breath especially after a cry. She is worried about any heart anomaly, and I had to explain possible causes for that. My explanation is as follows. Normally, functional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs by about 15 hours of life in healthy infants born at term. This occurs by abrupt contraction of the muscular wall of the ductus arteriosus, which is associated with increases in the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) coincident with the first breath. In some instances, this does not happen and may lead such kind of symptoms and may be kept open by the administration of prostaglandins. We have to do some investigations and clear it up. The  baby may need to undergo an echo, and some blood investigations.
