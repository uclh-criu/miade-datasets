Clinic note

Miss XXX is a 53-year-old bus driver who was referred from her GP for a DEXA bone scan.

She was concerned as her mother and maternal grandmother had osteoporosis in their early 50s and her maternal aunt had recently sustained a fractured neck of femur from a fall.

Her last period was two years previously, but she decided she did not want to take hormone replacement therapy as she was worried about the risks presented in the media and from talking to colleagues at work. She was otherwise fit and well with no past medical history of note. She takes vitamin D supplements daily.
