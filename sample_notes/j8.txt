    • D5- Bone marrow aspiration biopsy report- no infiltration by lymphoma or foreign cells, granulomata not seen, reactive marrow seen, compatible with inflammatory disease, malignancy is not seen
    • D8- biopsy of R/Clavicular lesion- done under GA

    • D15- Bone marrow trephine biopsy report- active marrow, no evidence of abnormal cell infiltration 

   Bone biopsy report-
Microscopic appearance-
     ~bone section show dense inflammatory cell infiltrate composed of neutrophils, epitheliod cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages and occasional eosinophills. There are no definite granulomata or caseation. There is necrosis of bone trabeculae surrounded by osteoclast like multinucleated giant cells. The surrounding area shows reactive bone formation. There is no evidence of malignancy.    
~soft tissue section show multiple fragments of tissue. One fragment contains a large granuloma with early caseation. The other fragments contain a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophils, epitheliod cells, lymphocutes, macrophages and eosinophils. There is no evidence of malignancy
Conclusion- TB osteomyelitis (2ry) - associated with acute inflammation

.
