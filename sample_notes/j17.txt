Case history  Accidental poisoning

Past History
11 April 2004 - A ‘friend’ had deliberately mixed ferric chloride to Mr.XXX’s bottle of water 
2 hrs after ingestion developed sever nausea and vomiting.
Treated at a base hospital symptomatically and transferred to the General Hospital 
While in hospital he developed progressive dysphagia with sensation of food getting stuck in the epigastrium. 
A gastrograffin study showed severe gastro-oesophageal reflux with changes suggestive of chronic gastritis with pyloric narrowing
He was then discharged with advice on semisolid – liquid like diet.
By next month, his symptoms got worse with significant dysphagia a considerable loss of weight. He was readmitted to the GH
An upper GI endoscopy was done and it confirmed the previous gastrograffin study findings. 
A feeding jejunostomy was done to facilitate enteral nutrition. Oesophageal dilatation was done twice to improve dysphagia. 
He was sent home after training on jejunostomy feeding. His jejunostomy was operated four times because of complications. Ultimately since his dysphagia did not improve and since the Jejunostomy was giving problems he presented to SJGH
Current admission
He was admitted to the GH on 07th June 
On admission to GH he appeared emaciated (body weight 40 Kg). His jejunostomy tube had been removed and was having an IV cannula affixed to the external jugular vein
O/E
The systemic examination was normal except for the nutritional inadequacy
A feeding jejunostomy was made on 8th June 2006 and he was begun on jejunostomy feeding. By the end of June, he was fit enough for major surgery and was prepared for it 
The operation was done on 27 June 2006. 
Post Op
Post operatively he developed fever spikes but they settled with antibiotics and the feeding jejunostomy was removed on day 10 
Discharge
Mr.XXX was discharged on the 11th post operative day on normal diet
After a month he was seen at the clinic and was progressing well
